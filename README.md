# üß† Parallel Physics & Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics

Advanced Unreal Engine Python scripts for high-fidelity physics simulation and AI-accelerated job scheduling.

- üéØ Minimum time halved ‚Äî your system now hits near-instant execution even more consistently.
- üöÄ Average time slashed by two-thirds ‚Äî this is where the real win lives. It means your scheduler isn‚Äôt just peaking occasionally; it‚Äôs living in the fast lane.
- üß† Maximum time slightly reduced ‚Äî even the worst-case scenarios are now less punishing.

## Overview

This repository contains two cutting-edge Python scripts designed for Unreal Engine:

### ‚öõÔ∏è Parallel-Physics

A modular, quantum-inspired physics simulation engine built for Unreal Engine‚Äôs Python API. It delivers high-fidelity, parallelized physics computation without external dependencies.

- **Quantum-inspired models** for energy, mass, and transformation
- **Parallel job processor** for real-time and batch physics updates
- **Modular architecture** for easy customization and extension
- **Unreal-native**: no NumPy or third-party Python libraries

### üß† Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics

An AI-enhanced job scheduler and simulation dispatcher using neural prediction and multi-threaded batching. Ideal for optimizing shader compilation, physics jobs, or other high-volume tasks.

- **Neural prediction** for job complexity and dynamic batching
- **Multi-threaded scheduler** for maximum CPU utilization
- **Python-native 3D grid engine** for field/environment manipulation
- **No external dependencies**: Unreal-ready, NumPy-free
- **Hooks for real ML models** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)

## üõ† Installation

1. Copy the desired script (`ParallelPhysics.py` or `Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics.py`) into your Unreal Engine project‚Äôs `Content/Python` directory or preferred Python execution path.
2. Enable Python scripting in Unreal:  
   `Plugins ‚Üí Scripting ‚Üí Python Editor Script Plugin`
3. Run via Unreal‚Äôs Python console:  
   ```text
   py <absolute_or_relative_path_to>/ParallelPhysics.py  
   py <absolute_or_relative_path_to>/Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics.py
   ```


4. **Run local benchmark tests:**

For each main script (e.g., `ParallelPhysics.py` and `Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics.py`), run:



## üöÄ Usage

### ParallelPhysics

- Defines multiple physics components and a central `QuantumPhysicsImprovement` class
- Includes example jobs and routines for stand-alone execution
- Adjustable parameters for mass, energy, and job queues
- Output logs display batch and parallel physics results

### Neural-Optimized-Parallel-Physics

- Simulates AI-driven worker pools for compiling shaders or batch jobs
- Adaptive field engine updates a Python-native 3D array
- Logs show worker performance and throughput
- Easily integrate real ML models by replacing placeholder logic

## üß¨ Editing & AI Integration

Both scripts are modular and designed for experimentation:

- Extend classes to test new physics models or interaction logic
- Replace core methods with AI/ML logic for optimization
- Integrate external inference endpoints or real-time predictors
- Use `NeuralJobPredictor` as a scaffold for production-grade ML batching


These tests execute 20 runs each to gather performance metrics.

5. **Review logs and charts:**

Benchmark results output detailed logs with job times. Use included scripts to generate charts and analyze performance.

## üìö Credits & Development

These scripts were developed through a conversation-driven workflow inspired by quantum physics, M-theory, and neural networks. Special care was taken to align with Unreal Engine‚Äôs Python API constraints:

- **Original algorithmic structure**: SlizzAi (2025)
- **Documentation & AI scaffolding**: Perplexity AI, Unreal Engine Python API community
- **Academic inspiration**: See ‚ÄúM-Theory, String Theory, and Physics‚Äù (attached)
